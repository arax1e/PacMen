# PacMen Factory Practice Activity 

## About the Project 
This is a practice activity for the MITxPro Professional Certificate in Full Stack Web Development. The purpose of the activity is for students to get familiar with the DOM and practice with this animation. In the animation, the user can press a button to add new PacMen. The PacMen will then move around the screen in random directions and at random velocities, bouncing off the edges of the window. 

## How to Run 
To run the PacMen factory animation, open the file on GitHub pages. Then click the "Add PacMan" button to add a new PacMan, and the "Start Game" button to start the animation.

## What's Next
In the future, I would like to add animation to make PacMan move his mouth, and potentially change some of the colors of the animation as well.
